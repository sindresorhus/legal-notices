# Takedown notice

Hello Sindre Sorhus,

We write to you again on behalf of Quora, Inc. (“Quora”) regarding the extension, titled “Quora Unblocker,” listed on the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quora-unblocker/pcjnlebeogfamlbeloiccdidgmaeojhe (the “Unblocker Extension” or “Extension”).

Quora owns and operates a popular on-line, collaborative, information sharing and learning website located at www.quora.com, and related mobile apps and services (collectively the “Quora Platform”). The mission of the Quora Platform is to share and grow the world’s knowledge through questions asked, answered, edited and organized by its participants. Today, the Quora Platform has more than 300 million monthly unique visitors, approximately half from the United States. With its user base now totaling over 300 million monthly unique visitors, the Quora Platform offers one of the most visited websites in the world; it consistently ranks among the top 100 most visited websites.

We understand you are the developer of Quora Unblocker. The Unblocker Extension allows users to bypass login prompts when accessing the Quora Platform, an activity that violates Quora’s Acceptable Use Policy. See https://www.quora.com/about/acceptable_use. Given this reason, we request that you remove the Unblocker Extension from the ChromeWeb Store in accordance with the Google Chrome Web Store Terms of Service.

Please confirm your intentions no later than September 18, 2019. We appreciate your previous cooperation and thank you in advance in helping us resolve this matter amicably. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
The Quora Team
