# Takedown notice

Hi Sindre Sorhus,

Thank you for being a loyal Quora user and fan. We appreciate your support! While sharing content, information, questions and answers is central to Quora’s mission, in order to protect our brand, we are mindful about how others use the QUORA trademarks.

We noticed that you are the developer of QUORA related extension, made available through the Chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quora-unblocker/pcjnlebeogfamlbeloiccdidgmaeojhe?hl=en

We are delighted to see our users engaging with our brand of question and answer services, but we are concerned about the manner in which you are currently using the QUORA mark.  Specifically featuring the well-known red and white registered QUORA trademark logo on your cover picture is likely to cause confusion among people who are looking for the authentic Quora company page.

We also noticed that you are reproducing Quora content via the Chrome web store in an unauthorized manner. Your unauthorized reproduction of the content on Quora infringes on Quora’s copyright and the copyrights of its users. Quora also has authority to act as a nonexclusive agent to take enforcement action against any unauthorized use by third-parties of content posted on the Quora Platform by its users. See Section 3 (c)(v) of our Terms of Service provided here:  https://www.quora.com/about/tos

In sum, we request that you cease: (i) using the QUORA trademark logo; and (ii) reproducing Quora content in an unauthorized manner.

We love hearing from our users and strongly encourage the free exchange of ideas. If you reference Quora, we ask you to do so in a way that is not confusing as to whether the page is sponsored by or affiliated with Quora. This would include not using the Quora logos or similar variations, not reproducing Quora content and not using Quora in an unauthorized manner.

We kindly request that you alter your Chrome web store page accordingly and make the requested changes within 3 days.

Thank you for being a loyal Quora user.

Sincerely,
Laura McIntosh
